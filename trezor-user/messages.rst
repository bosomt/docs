Signing messages
----------------

Signing messages can be used to prove ownership of a specific bitcoin address.

A common situation where this might be handy is:
You have your bitcoin exchange account protected with 2FA, but you lose access to your 2FA tool (mobile phone, email). To get your account unlocked, you can be asked by the exchange operator to sign some message with that bitcoin address associated with your exchange account.

In order to sign a message, select the Account in TREZOR Wallet and press **Sign & Verify** in the top right corner.  You should see a page like this:

**1. Signing the message**

Type in the message text into the **Message** field, then copy & paste the particular bitcoin addresses into the **Address** field (note it has to be a **used** address) and confirm by clicking on **Sign**.

**2. Confirming the signature on your TREZOR**

Check the text of the message on your TREZOR's display. If the text is correct, press the right button on your TREZOR to 'Confirm'.

Once you have confirmed the signature on your TREZOR, the signature will appear on the screen:

Verifying messages
------------------

In order to verify a message, select the Account at TREZOR Wallet and press **Sign & Verify** in the top right corner. You should see a page like this:

Click on 'Verify'.

**2. Validating on TREZOR**

TREZOR should show the beginning of the message on its display if verified correctly. Otherwise, you will get an error message on the TREZOR Wallet page.

Once you have confirmed the verification on your TREZOR, "Message verified" will appear on your computer screen:
