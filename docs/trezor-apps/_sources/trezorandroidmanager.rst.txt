TREZOR Manager (Android App)
----------------------------

TREZOR is becoming truly portable! With the release of our new TREZOR Manager application for Android, we are introducing an alternative method how to set up, customize and recover your TREZOR device even without a computer.

It should work on all phones that support USB Host. You will need an OTG cable to connect the TREZOR to your phone or tablet. The app was tested on LG Nexus 5 (Android 6) and Samsung Galaxy Alpha (Android 5).

Currently, the app can be only used for initializing the device, recovering the device, setting up the PIN code and passphrase, and some other settings.

In order to pay with TREZOR via your phone, you will have to install another application. The TREZOR Manager will direct you to Mycelium, as our application of choice.

You can download the TREZOR Manager app from `Google Play Store <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.trezor.app>`_, as a `binary APK <https://github.com/trezor/webwallet-data/raw/master/android/trezor-app-1.0.1.apk>`_ or see the `source code at Github <https://github.com/trezor/trezor-android>`_.

For further instructions how to use the App please check our :doc:`User Manual page <android>`.
