What is MyEtherWallet?
----------------------

`MyEtherWallet <https://myetherwallet.com/>`_ is an Ethereum web-wallet, which features TREZOR Integration. You can use MyEtherWallet to control your ethers stored with your TREZOR.

TREZOR User Manual
------------------

Your ethers are stored and protected by the same recovery seed, which you have been using for bitcoins and other crypto. Therefore, there are no changes to how you should use your TREZOR: Always protect the recovery seed. If you are familiar with how bitcoin works on TREZOR Wallet, the procedure is similar with Ethereum. You are just using a different wallet interface.

TREZOR supports Ethereum since firmware version 1.4.0. Please make sure your TREZOR is up-to-date before using storing ethers with TREZOR.

This guide assumes that your TREZOR has been already initialized, i.e. you have been using it with TREZOR Wallet, Electrum or Mycelium before. If not please `initialize your device first <https://trezor.io/start>`_.

Under no circumstances, please do NOT “Generate a new wallet” on MyEthereumWallet. Your Ethereum wallets are generated directly on your TREZOR, when you connect it to MyEthereumWallet by following the guide below.

Viewing Ethereum Wallet
-----------------------
First, make sure you are using the correct coin. Choose between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic using the selector in the top-right part of MyEtherWallet

Then select "Send Ether & Tokens", choose "TREZOR" and click on "Connect to TREZOR".

TREZOR Connect prompt will pop up, asking you to plug in your TREZOR device. Enter your PIN and Passphrase (if you have it enabled). Then, Connect will ask you to export your public key for Ethereum account #1. This is necessary, so that MEW can load your accounts and read their balance.

In the next window, you can see your ether addresses and their balances. You should use these to receive ethers in your TREZOR. All of these addresses have been generated by your TREZOR, using your seed. Any ethers send on these addresses will be controlled by your TREZOR.

If you would like to spend you ethers, you can continue by choosing the address you want to spend from and confirm by clicking on "Unlock".

Sending Transactions
--------------------

If you have selected “Send Ether & Tokens,” you can continue with these steps. At this stage, you are ready to send transactions. Enter the details and click on “Generate Transaction”.

Another TREZOR Connect prompt will show up and ask you to confirm the transaction on your TREZOR. (Your TREZOR has been unlocked in the previous stage.)

But here is the difference with what you might be used to in TREZOR Wallet. The transaction won’t be sent yet, even after confirming on the device. The signed data from TREZOR will be transmitted back to MEW, for one more confirmation. Only after clicking on “Send Transaction” will your ethers leave your account.
