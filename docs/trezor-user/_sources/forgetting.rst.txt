Logging out of TREZOR Wallet
============================

If you decide to use your TREZOR on a shared computer, such as at an Internet cafe or library, you probably don't want TREZOR Wallet to continue showing your device after you leave.  You can "log out" of TREZOR Wallet by selecting your TREZOR device on the left panel and pressing **Forget device**.
